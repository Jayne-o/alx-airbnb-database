Refactored Query + Indexing Tips
If performance is lagging, try these:
- Add indexes to frequently joined columns:
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_user_id ON Bookings(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_bookings_property_id ON Bookings(property_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_payments_booking_id ON Payments(booking_id);


- Use SELECT only on needed columns (avoid SELECT *)
- Consider materialized views if this query is run often and the data doesnâ€™t change frequently.
